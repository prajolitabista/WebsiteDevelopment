<p class="bold">1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.</p><br>
<p class="bold">2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>HTTP is called a stateless protocol because the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.</p><br>
<p class="bold">3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</p>
<p><b>Ans:</b>	The client (user agent-web browser) sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the page we are looking for and  with the help of numerous computers and machines the HTTP messages are relayed in the proxies which are sent to the server which serves the document as requested </p><br>
<p class="bold">4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>Get parameter us used to fetch resource whereas Post is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. </p><br>
<p class="bold">5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.
200 indicates sucessful response and 404 indicates the server can not find the requested resource.</p><br>

<p class="bold">6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>A HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. eg  It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. </p><br>

<p class="bold">7. Why are cookies a security issue?</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>Cookies are used to either falsify the identity of legitimate users or use the identity of legitimate users to perform malicious acts(Internet cookie fraud)</p><br>

<p class="bold">8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>Session hijacking consists of gaining access to and misusing a user's authenticated session. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code.  </p><br>

<p class="bold">9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that impersonates a trusted user and sends a website unwanted commands.</p><br>

<p class="bold">10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</p>
<p><b>Ans: </b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.Web fonts,Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage(),CSS Shapes from images use CORS</p><br>
